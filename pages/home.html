	This is a sample website that demonstrates the use of a framework I developed to help eliminate the need to rewrite the same code 
	over and over again. The structure of the framework makes use of XML for many things, such as the menu, news module, configuration 
	and more. Also, content for each page resides in an HTML file located in the pages directory of the folder structure. 
	The decision to structure the site this way was influenced by not having a MySQL database available to me on the first project I 
	developed this framework for.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, the way that the code is structures as well as the folders is by collecting all application specific code and data in 
	the application folder. In there you also have the controls libraries folder, data folder for application specific configuration 
	data and lastly the templates folder that contains the main templates for the web application. The templates are nothing more than 
	standard HTML files with place holders that the application classes will parse and replace with actual data.
</p>

<p>
	Beyond the application folder and its content there is the modules folder that contains a directory structure for modules that 
	have been developed for the site. You should notice that the directory structure follows a similar pattern that the application 
	directory structure does. Moving on, there is the navigation folder that contains everything to do with the menu system. Again, 
	the directory structure matches the established pattern.
</p>

<p>
	Next, you will notice the pages directory. This is where all HTML files that serve as a page belong. Again, the application 
	classes will take this information and place it in the appropriate place within the application. In studying the code you might 
	notice that when writing HTML code you have CSS to aid in presentation. Moving on, we have the public folder that contains sub 
	folders. Inside these folders you will find the style sheets folder, the JavaScript folder, the images folder and a documents 
	folder. Lastly we have the tmp folder that contains a logs folder where when errors occur in the website a log file is created. 
	The application is set up to support a page to view all logs written to this file, for example http://www.mysite.com/index.php?template=main&file=errors
