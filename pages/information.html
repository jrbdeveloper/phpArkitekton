Amadeus takes place in 18th Century Austria and tells the story of one of the greatest
musical prodigies ever known, <a href="http://www.amadeusimmortal.com/people/mozart.php">
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>. The story begins with ageing composer
<a href="http://www.amadeusimmortal.com/people/salieri.php">Antonio Salieri</a>
confessing his involvement in the death of Mozart. For you see, ever since
Antonio Salieri was a child he considered child prodigy Wolfgang Mozart to be his idol. As
he said, "He was my idol! I can't remember a time when I didn't know his name!" Antonio wanted
to be a great composer so desperately that he would pray to God to bring him the gift of
immortality through his music.
</p>

<p>Then one day, Salieri had the shock of his life when he realized that his idol 'Mozart'
was non-other than an obnoxious, immature, 'vulgar' man. "So that was he! That giggling,
dirty-minded creature I'd just seen crawling on the floor. Mozart. The phenomenon whose
legend had haunted my youth. Impossible."
</p>

<p>Salieri develops an overwhelming jealousy of Mozart's musical talent that eventually
grows into obsessive hatred. Salieri, a man who spent his entire life devoted to God so
that he could be a great composer has his talent overthrown by the childish Mozart. "Why?
Would God choose an obscene child to be His instrument?" Salieri vows to destroy Mozart, in
both name and body, in order to punish God for choosing Mozart as his instrument.
